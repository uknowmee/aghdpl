# Introduction

Reddit is a social media site that can be described as a collection of forums. Users share their questions, thoughts, and content, while other users can upvote or downvote them. The most popular posts are displayed on the front page, which is the first thing a user sees when they visit the site. Reddit is divided into subreddits [@https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-14683-2_9], which are forums dedicated to specific topics. Users can subscribe to subreddits they are interested in, and posts from these subreddits will appear on their front page, as shown in [@fig:reddit-home-page].
