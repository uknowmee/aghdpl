## Units

- Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ".5-inch disk drive".
- Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
- Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: "Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}" or "webers per square meter", not "webers/m\textsuperscript{2}".  Spell out units when they appear in text: "\dots a few henries", not "\dots a few H".
- Use a zero before decimal points: "0.25", not ".25". Use "cm\textsuperscript{3}", not "cc".
