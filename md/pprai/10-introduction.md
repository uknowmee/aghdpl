# Introduction

This demo file is intended to serve as a "starter file" for conference papers produced under \LaTeX. Margins, column widths, line spacing, and type styles are built-in; examples of the type styles are provided throughout this document. The various table text styles are provided. The formatter will need to create these components, incorporating the applicable criteria that follow. Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a separate text file. Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been formatted and styled. Do not use hard tabs, and limit use of hard returns to only one return at the end of a paragraph. Do not add any kind of pagination anywhere in the paper. Do not number text heads-the template will do that for you.
